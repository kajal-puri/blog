Ive looped through Nescafe Basement like 100 times the past two weeks and still cant get enough of it. This is the kind of music I like, the kind that just grows on you until you loop endlessly and then hate it <i class="em em-stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes"></i>

Anyway, the following is a list of songs that I have discovered and liked the most in the past two weeks.

### Tattva - aswekeepsearching
