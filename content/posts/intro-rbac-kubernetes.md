EKS uses a custom authenticator tool called "aws-iam-authenticator". The basic idea is to make the auth flow in EKS easier by using the tools you already use in AWS. 

![eks-auth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/images/eks-iam.png)

To wrap your head around the flow, consider three separate entities: 

- A kubernetes resource (entire namespace, specific pods/configs etc)
- An action (get, watch, list, create, delete etc)
- An IAM role/user created on AWS

Your usecase might be to give an IAM role access to a Kubernetes namespace for example with certain restricted actions. 

Since K8s is basically client-server communication with the API server, we must need to perform the following two things for every single API request which goes to the control plane:

- *Authentication*

`kubectl` talks to the API server using the token generated by `aws-iam-authenticator`.  The API server passes on this info to the AWS servers which validated if the originating call is coming from a valid IAM user or not. If not, the access is denied from K8s.

- *Authorization*

Once the IAM user is validated, the IAM user needs to be mapped to a user to perform Authorization so K8s API server can know whether the action/resource requested for is to be allowed or not. This is where the `aws-auth-cm.yml` comes into the picture. It is basically a map of all IAM users with internal K8s groups or users created. The roles are assosciated to these users/groups so once the mapping is done, K8s API server can know what to do with the API request.

### How does EKS know my IAM?
If you configured your `KUBECONFIG` correctly using `aws eks update-kubeconfig` then you'll find the below lines in your config file. This basically runs a `aws cli` command to find your IAM user/role configured on your system to produce a token. 

```
   exec:
      apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1
      args:
      - token
      - -i
      - eks-zero-public
      command: aws-iam-authenticator
```

### Show me the YAML already

- To create a Role and RoleBinding

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: coolapp
  name: fullaccess
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: ["extensions"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: ["autoscaling"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
---
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: 10xdevs-fullaccess
  namespace: coolapp
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: 10xdevs
  namespace: coolapp
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: fullaccess
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

So, for all the normal folks who don't grok YAML as fast as 10x devops engineers, I am basically creating a Role `fullaccess` with all permissions for a namespace `coolapp` (innovative, ikr). Then I am `binding` this Role to a Group called `10xdevs` so that the group is allocated the role which has permissions. We will use this group `10xdevs` to map our AWS user now. 

- To create the map of IAM Role/User ARN with the above Role

Edit your `aws-auth-cm.yml` and add the below stuff:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: aws-auth
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  mapRoles ... <skipping> ...

  mapUsers: |
    - userarn: arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/<user-name>
      username: 10xdevs-fullaccess # RoleBinding name created in previous step
      groups:
        - 10xdevs # Group name created in previous step
```

### Verify it yourself

- `kubectl auth can-i create pods --all-namespaces`: _should fail_

- `kubectl auth can-i create pods -n coolapp`: _should work_

Fin!
